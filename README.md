# Programming Fundamentals C++ Assignments

## 💡 Overview
This repository contains four beginner-level C++ programs developed as part of Programming Fundamentals coursework. These assignments focus on understanding arrays, loops, user input, and basic logic building using C++.

## 📌 Features
- Replace a specific element in a 1D array based on user input.
- Calculate the sum of all elements in a 3x3 2D array.
- Find the maximum value in a 4x4 2D array filled by the user.
- Display a predefined 2D array in a formatted table layout using `<iomanip>`.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts Used**:
  - 1D and 2D Arrays
  - Loops (for, nested for)
  - Conditional statements
  - I/O with `cin`, `cout`
  - Header: `<iostream>`, `<iomanip>`

## 🚀 How to Run
> Use any C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Code::Blocks) to compile and run the programs.
